## Weekend Movie Trip

This project accomplishes the following<br>

1. Set up a data science project structure in a new git repository in your GitHub account<br>
2. Download the one of the MovieLens datasets from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/<br>
3. Load the data set into panda data frames<br>
4. Formulate one or two ideas on how the combination of ratings and tags by users helps the data set to establish additional value using exploratory data analysis<br>
5. Build one or more clustering models to determine similar movies to recommend using the other ratings and tags of movies by other users as features<br>
6. Document your process and results<br>
7. Commit your notebook, source code, visualizations and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub<br>


## Results

The kmeans and DBSCAN models were used to predict similar movies. Each had unsimilar movies, but kmeans performed a bit better
